## I want to do everything {#i-want-to-do-everything}

I want to do everything. I want to learn languages. I want to learn math. I want to learn piano. I want to learn photography. I want to become really good at programming. I want to read more philosophy. I want to learn chess. I want to paint. I want to meditate. I want to think more. I want to travel, to eat new food, to see new places, to see new faces.

I want to do everything at once so much I don't even know what to start with -- so I'm not **really** doing anything.

I don't know what to do. I'm afraid to commit to something. I know that if I want to be good at something, I'd have to give it all of my time -- be fully absorbed by it. I don't want to be mediocre. I'd have to _go all the way_. Perhaps that's toxic -- perhaps I could just enjoy some things as hobbies. But that would only distract me from my main thing.

I want to do one thing, and do everything -- all at the same time.

Maybe the fact that I'm even thinking about this means that programming is not _my thing_. Maybe if it were, I'd give it all of my time without thinking about trying something else. I'd be happy for programming to be _my thing_, without even thinking of regretting not trying something else.

What if Newton stopped at alchemy? I'm not Newton, but what if I could be? Am I depriving the world of a Newton by not trying different things? Or by not working hard enough at the one thing I happen to love right now?
