## Read Less Think More {#read-less-think-more}

Books are just content if you're not thinking about what you're reading. The same for paintings, music, cinema. Don't just consume. Actively ask questions. Actively imagine. Write your thoughts. See deeper.

Think about art as you walk to the shop, as you wait in line, as you're in the bus.
