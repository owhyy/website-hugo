## Real world Redis {#real-world-redis}

The book has you create and implement a market web app, your own search autocompleter and a social media app, all in python, all using redis as the database. It assumes no knowledge of Redis, and teaches you everything from the base up.

I haven't read it yet, just skimmed through it, and the examples it uses are really cool, as they're essentially what you'd do on real projects.
