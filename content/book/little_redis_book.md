## A Little book about Redis {#a-little-book-about-redis}

This 31-paged book will teach you everything you need to know to understand what redis is. It assumes you'll learn everything you need by reading documentation, so it only teaches you the basics: data structures, basic operations, some simple to make mistakes and how to fix them.

I have read it when I was interested in learning redis, but haven't really got the chance to apply it, so I forgot most of the stuff. I suggest you don't make my mistake, and only pick this up if you're actually using redis for something, and want to get a deeper understanding. **However, you might not even need the book**, as everything here is so simple you'll figure it out by yourself as you play with redis.

For a more serious book that teaches you how to actually use redis in real world applications, you can take a look at [Redis in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/redis-in-action).
