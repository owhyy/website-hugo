It assumes you&amp;rsquo;ll learn everything you need by reading documentation, so it only teaches you the basics: data structures, basic operations, some simple to make mistakes and how to fix them.
I have read it when I was interested in learning redis, but haven&amp;rsquo;t really got the chance to apply it, so I forgot most of the stuff.</description></item><item><title>Redis in Action by Josiah Carlson</title><link>https://babinion.xyz/book/redis-in-action-by-josiah-carlson/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://babinion.xyz/book/redis-in-action-by-josiah-carlson/</guid><description>Real world Redis The book has you create and implement a market web app, your own search autocompleter and a social media app, all in python, all using redis as the database. It assumes no knowledge of Redis, and teaches you everything from the base up.
I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet, just skimmed through it, and the examples it uses are really cool, as they&amp;rsquo;re essentially what you&amp;rsquo;d do on real projects.</description></item></channel></rss>
