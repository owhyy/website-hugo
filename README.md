This is the repository for [my website](babinion.xyz), on which I *try to* write about random computer-science related stuff, review books, movies, and share notes from college.

## How can I help?

If you have any sugestions, noticed any spelling or grammar errors, or found a code piece that isn't working -- you're encouraged to open a pull request, which I'll gladly take a look at whenever I get the time.
